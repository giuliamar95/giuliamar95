::: {#hero-heading}
I am a postdoctoral researcher in the PreMeDICaL Inria-Inserm team with Julie Josse. My current research focuses on missing data and synthetic data generation. I completed my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Inria and Université Côte d'Azur, under the supervision of Charles Bouveyron and Marco Corneli. During my Ph.D, my research primarily focused model-based clustering methods for dynamic bipartite networks, with applications in pharmacovigilance.
